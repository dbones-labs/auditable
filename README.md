# auditable

This is a small auditing framework, the library was pulled out of an on-going project in dbones labs.

The need for auditing already exists in projects, the requirement to log information to prove something happened, but also to capture who, what and when a business action happened.

# A teaser of code

```

public class ContractsController 
{
    public ContractsController()
    {

    }
}

```
