#  Explicit vs Observed üîç

`auditable` support what we call are auditable changes which are either explicit or observed


|                  | Explicit                                       | Observed                                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| description      | Your code tells `auditable` the type of change | `auditable` compairs the state and figures out what has happened  |


In the docs (Features section) we will tell you if the code will be Explicit or Observed.
