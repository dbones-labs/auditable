# Welcome to `auditable`

This is a small auditing framework

The need for auditing already exists in projects, the requirement to log information to prove something happened, but also to capture who, what and when a business action happened.


## Show me some Code!

have a look at our Quick Start section, you will see how to setup the skeleton of the project and start using `auditable`


## Use of this library

As this is about auditing your code, it is recommend that you fully test your use-cases to ensure that the requirement is met fully.
